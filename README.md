# Car Price Prediction

**Car Price Prediction** is a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. This project uses regression techniques to estimate the car's value.

## 🚗 Features

- Predicts car prices using multiple regression models.
- Performs data preprocessing and feature encoding.
- Evaluates models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².
- Offers a clean and readable notebook for exploration.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/Car-Price-Prediction.git
cd Car-Price-Prediction
```

2. **Run the Notebook**:

Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE to open:

```bash
Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Load the dataset.
2. Explore and clean the data.
3. Encode categorical variables.
4. Split into training and testing sets.
5. Train regression models and evaluate performance.
6. Predict prices for new input data.
